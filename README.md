# SecureOTP

SecureOTP is a simple and secure One-Time Password (OTP) generator built with Python. It uses Python's `secrets` module to generate cryptographically strong OTPs to enhance security for authentication and verification processes.

## Features

- Generates numeric OTPs by default (configurable length).
- Uses the secure `secrets` module for true randomness.
- Easy to use and integrate into any Python project.
- Includes basic tests to ensure functionality.

## Usage

```python
from secure_otp import generate_otp

otp = generate_otp(length=6)
print("Generated OTP:", otp)
````

## Installation

Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Valuable Additional Features to Enhance SecureOTP

To make SecureOTP more robust and versatile, consider adding the following features:

1. **Alphanumeric OTPs**
   Allow OTPs to include uppercase, lowercase letters, and digits for increased complexity.

2. **Expiry Timer**
   Generate OTPs with a timestamp and verify if the OTP is still valid within a certain time window (e.g., 5 minutes).

3. **Send OTP via Email or SMS**
   Integrate with email services (SMTP) or SMS APIs like Twilio to send OTPs directly to users.

4. **Retry Limits & Lockouts**
   Implement logic to limit the number of verification attempts and lock users after multiple failed attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

5. **User Association**
   Link OTPs to specific users or phone numbers and manage OTP generation and verification per user.

6. **Logging & Auditing**
   Keep logs of OTP generation and verification attempts for security audits and monitoring.

7. **Customizable OTP Length and Charset**
   Allow customization of OTP length and allowed characters, including digits, letters, and symbols.

8. **GUI or Web Interface**
   Build a simple GUI (using Tkinter) or a web app (using Flask or FastAPI) for user-friendly OTP generation and verification.

9. **QR Code Generation**
   Generate QR codes that encode OTPs for quick scanning and verification.

10. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Integration**
    Use the OTP generator as part of a 2FA system integrated into existing authentication workflows.
